/*
An interface for commandable objects, which are part of the command design pattern.
The commandable object exposes its functonality as commands and events groupped into a CommandSet.

This interface is typically implemented by controllers and is used to auto generate external interfaces.

 type MyDataController {
  _commandSet  CommandSet;
 }
   func (dc *MyDataController) getCommandSet() CommandSet {
     if (dc._commandSet == nil)
       dc._commandSet = NewDataCommandSet();
     return dc._commandSet;
   }

type ICommandable interface {
	// 	Gets a command set with all supported commands and events.
	// see
	// CommandSet
	// Returns *CommandSet
	// a command set with commands and events.
	GetCommandSet() *CommandSet
}
